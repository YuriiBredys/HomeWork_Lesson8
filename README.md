# HomeWork Lesson 8
* Task 1 <br/>
Read the matrix N * N integers from the input.txt file. Sort each
ascending line (using std :: sort). Record the result
matrix in the output.txt file. Determine the dimension of the matrix from the rows themselves
file input.txt, the file should not have a separate line with the dimension required
detect automatically. Use to split the input string into numbers
getLine function. 
* Task 2 <br/>
Read the matrix N * N integers from the input.txt file. Sort each
growth column (using std :: sort). Record the result
matrix in the output.txt file. Determine the dimension of the matrix from the rows themselves
file input.txt, the file should not have a separate line with the dimension required
detect automatically. Use to split the input string into numbers
getLine function.
* Task 3 <br/>
